## What is this example

This example covers a way to make a Twitch Chat client/bot in nodeJS

This example differs from the Example one folder up, as this uses a "template" file so the Chat Parsing logic is in a seperate file and emits events.

So you can run a lot of bots out of one folder without copy/pasting all the parsing logic into multiple files and a single change to the central libray updates all bots.

A rising tide lifts all boats?
