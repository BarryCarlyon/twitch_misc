# Whats in this Repo

This repo contains a bunch of examples and bits and pieces that might be useful it might not.

## Languages

Most of these examples either use NodeJS or PHP or pure HTML (with Javascript) (using a dumb `php -S` to serve the demo, as apposed to file:// to avoid some oddities)

Aside from that the dependencies are supposed to be as lightweight as possible.

## LIVE EXAMPLES

These examples are testable on GitHub pages, and will prompt for implicit authentication to run the code.

## Twitch Extensions

There are some useful bits for Twitch Extensions in this repo, mainly for the [API side of things](https://github.com/BarryCarlyon/twitch_misc/tree/main/extensions).

If you are after a demo of a Twitch Extension with an EBS that talks to the Twitch API, checkout the [Twitch Profile Extension](https://github.com/BarryCarlyon/twitch_profile_extension) Repository instead

Looking to get started wtih JWT auth, but you just want to start making requests. Try this [insomnia](https://insomnia.rest) plugin: ["twitch extension"](https://github.com/BarryCarlyon/insomnia-plugin-twitch-extension-barrycarlyon) which includes a "predefined" request collection to import too!

Or looking to get started with Extension Development and the various API calls outside of a Rest client in a Desktop Application Similar to the Developer Rig? Check out [BarryCarlyon's Twitch Extension Tools](https://github.com/barrycarlyon/twitch_extension_tools).

## Practical Examples

Most of the code in this repository is various bits and pieces for your to copy/paste in other projects.

However the [examples](examples) folder will contain self contained examples that demonstrate a more full "product".
