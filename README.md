# Whats in this Repo

This repo contains a bunch of examples and bits and pieces that might be useful it might not.

## Langauges

Most of these examples either use NodeJS or PHP or pure HTML (with Javascript) (using a dumb `php -S` to serve the demo, as apposed to file:// to avoid some oddities)

Aside from that the dependencies are supposed to be as lightweight as possible.


## LIVE EXAMPLES

These examples are testable on GitHub pages, and will prompt for implicit authentication to run the code.
