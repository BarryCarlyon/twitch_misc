## What is in this example

This example demonstrates how to take the iCal feed of one or more channels and display it on a [Calendar JS](https://www.calendar-js.com/) calendar, it utilises [ical.js by kewisch](https://kewisch.github.io/ical.js) to parse the iCalendar to jCal to then pass to the Calendar.

The [Twitch iCalendar API](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/reference/#get-channel-icalendar) doesn't require authentication!
