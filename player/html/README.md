## What is this example

This is an example of using the Twitch player and adding a number of Controls to it.

It uses [Embed Everything](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/embed/everything)

Since it uses the JS Embed Library, you do not need to specify the `parent` as the JS Library will work it out for you

This example is based on this ["Web" Example](https://twitch.extensions.barrycarlyon.co.uk/temp/player_test.html) that exists on my Extensions Website for test purposes

## Running the example

This is so rough that you need to upload it somewhere or know how to start a WebServer on 127.0.0.1 port 80 locally

If you have PHP installed

> sudo php -S 127.0.0.1:80

Will get you going real quick
